## Get best windsuring conditions for a location

External API to get forecast from: Weatherbit API https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-forecast-16-day

The best location for windsurfing is calculated with the formula:

*If the wind speed is not within <5; 18> (m/s) and the temperature is not in the range <5; 35> (Â°C), the location is not suitable for windsurfing. 
However, if they are in these ranges, then the best location is determined by the highest value calculated from the following formula:
v * 3 + temp.*

If none of the locations meets the above criteria, the application does not return any

  "city": "Fortalza",
